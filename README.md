Hello jobSity tester!
Here you will find the Front end for my chat web app

In order to run it you need NodeJs => https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

I also recommend using Visual Studio Code => https://code.visualstudio.com/

Then:

1) Clone this repo => git clone https://github.com/maximojgonzalezc/MaximoChatFE.git
2) Open and step into the MaximoChatFE folder
3) run 'npm install' command
4) After installing dependencies run 'mpn start' command, and after compiled, open your browser at "http://localhost:3000"
